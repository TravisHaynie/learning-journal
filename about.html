                            Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.

                    <h2 class="post-header">How I stay committed to learning</h2>
                    <p>
                        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, 
                        then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                    </p>    
                    <p class="post-p">
                        While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most 
                        things about my journey with the world.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="post-header">How I got started</h2>
                    <p>   
                        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning.
                        After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries 
                        of what I learned using my own words.
                    </p>
                    <p class="post-p">    
                        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping 
                        others learn and stay motivated.
