            <h2 class="post-header">How I stay committed to learning</h2>
            <p> 
                I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create
                simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
            </p>    
            <p class="post-p">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things
                 about my journey with the world.
            </p>
            <h2 class="post-header">
                How I got started
            </h2>
            <p>   
                I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning.
                 After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries 
                 of what I learned using my own words.
            </p>
            <p class="post-p">    
                That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping 
                others learn and stay motivated.
